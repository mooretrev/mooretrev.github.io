            I have two projects that proud enough to show off. The first was the Random Inventory Auditor which
            was mentioned in the about me page. The second is checker app that I worked on while I was bored during
            the summer.

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/mooretrev/UploadRandomInventory">Random Inventory Auditor</a></h2>
         <p>
             I mentioned the program a little bit in the about me page, but I will full explain its purpose here. 
             The purpose was for program to create a report of spare parts to be counted. Also, the report was weighted 
             towards more expensive items, so we were counting the more valuable parts. This program was to help us have 
             more accurate data of what is in inventory.
         </p>
         <h2><a href="https://github.com/mooretrev/Checkers">Checkers</a></h2>
         <p>
             This was my attempt and making a iOS game. I added half of the checkers game. Meaning the game would force
             you to take turns and you could jump other players. However, there were no double jumps or kings.
