                     <br>
                     My name is Trevor. I am a junior studing, <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html">Computer Science and Engineering</a>.
                      My career goals are to be 
                     a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineer">software engineer</a> in the energy sector, then move into real estate investment. Most of my family is
                     in the real estate market as a <a href="https://www.har.com/jason-moore/agent_MOOREJAY">realtor</a> 
                      or <a href="http://www.homeusa.com/team">loan officer</a>. So, the information passed on to me would make me 
                     very productive in that market.

                    <h2>Data Science </h2>
                    <p>
                        I took a <a href="https://www.stat.tamu.edu/">Statics class</a>  my sophomore year of college, and it peaked my interest. 
                        I would need more about the data science field before I decided to take my career in that
                        direction. However, I really liked the little exposure I had to it.

                 <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
                 <p>
                     In summer 2019, I had an intership at <a href="https://www.edpr.com/">EDP Renewables</a>. They are a renewable energy company specilizing in 
                     wind farms. I was apart of the central maintenance team. Our main responisblility was keeping the wind turbine
                     online. Apart of keeping the turbines online was making sure we had spare parts for our turbines. So, one of my projects
                     was to develop a Random Inventory Auditor that would generate a report of spare parts to count. This was keep our stock
                     levels correct. Developing this Random Invetory Auditor was my largest coding project and my introduction into software
                     engineering. I'm excited to take on more larger projects like the Random Inventory Auditor.

                 <h2>Slalom Skiing</h2>
                 <p>
                     I joined the <a href="https://maroonlink.tamu.edu/organization/waterskiclub">TAMU ski team </a> because I wanted to get better at skiing. Skiing has always been a part 
                     of my family. My dad grew up doing. My mom grew up doing. Naturally, they passed that passion on 
                     to me. However, my family only goes to the lake once a summer, so I have never got practice into 
                     get good at skiing. Now that I am on the ski team, I plan on overtaking my mom as the best skiier in
                     the family.
